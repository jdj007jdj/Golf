## 2025-07-14 21:15:00 - CRITICAL SESSION: APK Build Issues

### Problem Summary
- **Issue**: Mobile APK builds today cannot connect to backend, but yesterday's APK works fine
- **Impact**: Development blocked, cannot test new features on device
- **Urgency**: Critical - affects all mobile development workflow

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Network Security Config**: Added `android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"` to AndroidManifest.xml today
2. **IP Restriction**: Config only allowed HTTP traffic to old IP (192.168.0.123), not new IP (192.168.0.127)
3. **Build Differences**: 
   - Yesterday's working APK: 153MB (all architectures, no network restrictions)
   - Today's broken APK: 49MB (missing architectures, network restricted)

### Actions Taken
1. **Network Setup**: ‚úÖ Backend running correctly on WSL2, accessible via Windows browser
2. **Port Forwarding**: ‚úÖ Configured Windows ‚Üí WSL2 port proxy for new IP
3. **Git Revert**: ‚úÖ Reset to yesterday's working commit (bda4a40) from July 13th
4. **IP Update**: ‚úÖ Updated API_HOST from 192.168.0.123 to 192.168.0.127 in api.js
5. **Build Attempts**: ‚ùå Multiple APK build attempts timing out or incomplete

### Current State
- **Git HEAD**: bda4a40 (July 13th working commit)
- **Network Config**: Removed (yesterday's state had no restrictions)
- **Backend**: Running and accessible
- **Build Status**: Attempting to complete APK build from yesterday's clean state

### Next Steps Required
1. Complete APK build from yesterday's commit with updated IP
2. Test new APK connects to backend with new IP address
3. Once working, carefully investigate what changed today to prevent regression

### Files Modified This Session
- `/mobile/src/config/api.js` - Updated API_HOST IP address
- `.claude/context/session.md` - Updated with current crisis
- `.claude/context/DevelopmentLog.md` - This entry

### Technical Notes
- WSL2 IP: 172.29.177.0
- Windows IP: 192.168.0.127 (changed from 192.168.0.123)
- Backend Port: 3000
- Metro Port: 8081 (adb reverse configured)

## 2025-07-14 21:40:00 - CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED: APK BUILD SUCCESS

### Problem Resolution Summary
- **Issue**: APK build was broken, producing 49MB non-functional APKs
- **Root Cause**: Network security config and build cache issues
- **Solution**: Clean build from yesterday's working commit with updated IP
- **Result**: Successfully built 150MB functional APK

### Successful Build Process
1. **Environment Verification**: Confirmed stable versions (RN 0.76.5, Gradle 8.7, Java 17)
2. **Cache Cleaning**: `./gradlew clean` - cleared all build artifacts (7s)
3. **Clean Build**: `./gradlew assembleDebug --stacktrace` (4.7 minutes)
4. **APK Generation**: 150MB APK with all architectures included
5. **Network Test**: ‚úÖ Successfully connects to backend at 192.168.0.127:3000
6. **Deployment**: APK copied to C:\Users\Jano\Desktop\golf.apk

### Build Performance Metrics
- **Total Build Time**: 4 minutes 47 seconds
- **APK Size**: 150MB (vs broken 49MB)
- **Architectures**: armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64 ‚úÖ
- **Native Modules**: All compiled successfully
- **Network Config**: Updated API_HOST to 192.168.0.127 ‚úÖ

### Critical Lessons Learned
1. **Build Process Documentation**: Created MobileBuildProcess.md for future reference
2. **Environment Stability**: Never change versions mid-project
3. **Build Time Expectations**: 4-8 minutes is normal for native modules
4. **APK Size Validation**: <100MB indicates missing architectures
5. **Clean State**: Always run gradlew clean before troubleshooting

### Files Modified This Session
- `/mobile/src/config/api.js` - Updated API_HOST IP address
- `.claude/context/session.md` - Updated crisis resolution status
- `.claude/context/DevelopmentLog.md` - This entry

### Development Status
- **Crisis**: RESOLVED ‚úÖ
- **APK Build**: FUNCTIONAL ‚úÖ 
- **Network Connectivity**: WORKING ‚úÖ
- **Development Workflow**: RESTORED ‚úÖ
- **Next**: Resume incremental development per IncrementalProjectPlan.md

### Impact
