## 2025-07-14 21:15:00 - CRITICAL SESSION: APK Build Issues

### Problem Summary
- **Issue**: Mobile APK builds today cannot connect to backend, but yesterday's APK works fine
- **Impact**: Development blocked, cannot test new features on device
- **Urgency**: Critical - affects all mobile development workflow

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Network Security Config**: Added `android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"` to AndroidManifest.xml today
2. **IP Restriction**: Config only allowed HTTP traffic to old IP (192.168.0.123), not new IP (192.168.0.127)
3. **Build Differences**: 
   - Yesterday's working APK: 153MB (all architectures, no network restrictions)
   - Today's broken APK: 49MB (missing architectures, network restricted)

### Actions Taken
1. **Network Setup**: ‚úÖ Backend running correctly on WSL2, accessible via Windows browser
2. **Port Forwarding**: ‚úÖ Configured Windows ‚Üí WSL2 port proxy for new IP
3. **Git Revert**: ‚úÖ Reset to yesterday's working commit (bda4a40) from July 13th
4. **IP Update**: ‚úÖ Updated API_HOST from 192.168.0.123 to 192.168.0.127 in api.js
5. **Build Attempts**: ‚ùå Multiple APK build attempts timing out or incomplete

### Current State
- **Git HEAD**: bda4a40 (July 13th working commit)
- **Network Config**: Removed (yesterday's state had no restrictions)
- **Backend**: Running and accessible
- **Build Status**: Attempting to complete APK build from yesterday's clean state

### Next Steps Required
1. Complete APK build from yesterday's commit with updated IP
2. Test new APK connects to backend with new IP address
3. Once working, carefully investigate what changed today to prevent regression

### Files Modified This Session
- `/mobile/src/config/api.js` - Updated API_HOST IP address
- `.claude/context/session.md` - Updated with current crisis
- `.claude/context/DevelopmentLog.md` - This entry

### Technical Notes
- WSL2 IP: 172.29.177.0
- Windows IP: 192.168.0.127 (changed from 192.168.0.123)
- Backend Port: 3000
- Metro Port: 8081 (adb reverse configured)

## 2025-07-14 21:40:00 - CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED: APK BUILD SUCCESS

### Problem Resolution Summary
- **Issue**: APK build was broken, producing 49MB non-functional APKs
- **Root Cause**: Network security config and build cache issues
- **Solution**: Clean build from yesterday's working commit with updated IP
- **Result**: Successfully built 150MB functional APK

### Successful Build Process
1. **Environment Verification**: Confirmed stable versions (RN 0.76.5, Gradle 8.7, Java 17)
2. **Cache Cleaning**: `./gradlew clean` - cleared all build artifacts (7s)
3. **Clean Build**: `./gradlew assembleDebug --stacktrace` (4.7 minutes)
4. **APK Generation**: 150MB APK with all architectures included
5. **Network Test**: ‚úÖ Successfully connects to backend at 192.168.0.127:3000
6. **Deployment**: APK copied to C:\Users\Jano\Desktop\golf.apk

### Build Performance Metrics
- **Total Build Time**: 4 minutes 47 seconds
- **APK Size**: 150MB (vs broken 49MB)
- **Architectures**: armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64 ‚úÖ
- **Native Modules**: All compiled successfully
- **Network Config**: Updated API_HOST to 192.168.0.127 ‚úÖ

### Critical Lessons Learned
1. **Build Process Documentation**: Created MobileBuildProcess.md for future reference
2. **Environment Stability**: Never change versions mid-project
3. **Build Time Expectations**: 4-8 minutes is normal for native modules
4. **APK Size Validation**: <100MB indicates missing architectures
5. **Clean State**: Always run gradlew clean before troubleshooting

### Files Modified This Session
- `/mobile/src/config/api.js` - Updated API_HOST IP address
- `.claude/context/session.md` - Updated crisis resolution status
- `.claude/context/DevelopmentLog.md` - This entry

## 2025-01-15 - MapLibre Bridgeless Mode Compatibility Issue

### Problem Discovered
- **Issue**: MapLibre GL v10.2.0 is incompatible with React Native 0.76.5's bridgeless mode
- **Symptoms**: All MapLibre native HTTP requests get canceled, falling back to vector tiles
- **Root Cause**: React Native 0.76.5 has bridgeless mode enabled by default
- **Impact**: Cannot display satellite imagery using standard MapLibre approach

### Investigation Process
1. Created test screens to isolate the issue
2. Confirmed JavaScript fetch() works perfectly for MapTiler API
3. Discovered MapLibre's native HTTP stack is incompatible with bridgeless architecture
4. Cannot disable bridgeless mode without rebuilding APK (user constraint)

### Solution Implemented
- **Approach**: JavaScript-based tile fetching workaround
- **Implementation**: Created SatelliteMapView component using MapLibre's ImageSource
- **Result**: Successfully displays satellite tiles without native HTTP requests
- **Benefits**: Works with hot reload, no APK rebuild required

### Files Created
- `/mobile/src/components/SatelliteMapView.js` - Working satellite map component
- `/mobile/src/utils/MapTilerProxy.js` - Tile fetching utilities
- `/mobile/src/utils/CustomTileSource.js` - Custom tile source implementation
- `/mobile/src/TestMapScreen.js` - Test screen to verify satellite tiles

### Technical Details
- MapLibre ImageSource components use React Native's Image loading mechanism
- Tiles are fetched via JavaScript fetch() and rendered as overlays
- Dynamic tile loading based on map bounds and zoom level
- Tile caching implemented to improve performance

### Commits
- `2156fbf` - Implement MapTiler satellite tile fetch workaround
- `84f9abb` - Revert bridgeless mode override in MainApplication.kt
- `a208221` - MapTiler satellite tiles working via JavaScript fetch

### Next Steps
- Replace MapViewMapLibre.js with SatelliteMapView approach
- Test GPS functionality with new implementation
- Remove test files once migration is complete
- Update production MapView component

### Documentation Updated
- Claude.md - Added bridgeless mode issue documentation
- GoogleToMaplibre.md - Updated with Phase 3.5 workaround details

## 2025-01-17 - Club Management System Implementation Complete

### Completed Tasks
- **Fixed Database Schema**: Resolved foreign key constraint violation in Shot model that was preventing shot sync
- **Implemented Club Management**: Created comprehensive UUID-based club system with ClubService and default clubs
- **Built Smart Club Selector**: Created intelligent club selection modal with hole-based suggestions per user specifications
- **Enhanced Shot Sync**: Added partial sync success handling with detailed error reporting
- **Fixed UI Integration**: Resolved showClubModal reference error after refactoring from old club selection UI

### Technical Achievements
1. **Database Fix**: Removed incorrect User relation from Shot model in Prisma schema
2. **Club Model**: Created Club.js with UUID generation and performance tracking
3. **Club Service**: Implemented clubService.js for managing user's golf bag with 12 default clubs
4. **Smart Selector**: Built SmartClubSelector.js with intelligent recommendations based on:
   - Historical usage per hole
   - Distance-based suggestions  
   - Quick alternatives for clubs hitting nearer/farther
   - Easy access to full club selection
5. **Shot Tracking**: Enhanced shot sync to handle partial failures and invalid club IDs

### Files Modified/Created
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Fixed Shot model foreign key constraint
- `mobile/src/models/Club.js` - New club data model with UUID system
- `mobile/src/services/clubService.js` - Club management service with defaults
- `mobile/src/components/SmartClubSelector.js` - Intelligent club selection modal
- `mobile/src/screens/rounds/components/ScorecardView.js` - Integrated smart club selector
- `mobile/src/screens/rounds/components/ScorecardContainer.js` - Removed old club modal references
- `mobile/src/services/offlineQueueService.js` - Enhanced with partial sync handling

### Problem Resolution
- **Original Issue**: Shots weren't syncing due to foreign key constraint violation and invalid club IDs
- **Discovery**: Shots WERE syncing to database but 4 demo shots failed due to string club IDs instead of UUIDs
- **Solution**: Fixed schema issue and implemented proper club management with UUID-based system
- **User Feedback**: Addressed specific request for separate modal with smart suggestions based on hole history

### Git Commits
- `4cb5339` - "Mobile: Implement comprehensive club management system with smart selection"
- **Files Changed**: 24 files, 4,296 insertions, 989 deletions
