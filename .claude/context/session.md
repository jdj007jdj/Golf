# Current Session Context

## Session Information
- **Session Start**: 2025-01-11 18:45:00 SAST
- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-12 10:45:00 SAST
- **Current Phase**: 1
- **Active Feature**: Development Environment Setup & Phase 1 Preparation

## Project State
- **Project Type**: full-stack
- **Project Name**: Golf
- **Setup Complete**: true
- **Architecture Files Loaded**: web.md, mobile.md

## Current Work
- **Working On**: Fixing TypeScript errors in backend routes to start server
- **Files Modified**: mobile.md (architecture), development-status.md, package.json files, prisma/schema.prisma, roundRoutes.ts
- **Next Task**: Get backend server running with simplified routes, then fix complex route logic

## Active Tasks
- [x] Set up Docker services (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- [x] Install mobile dependencies with version compatibility fixes
- [x] Troubleshoot React Native CLI compatibility issues
- [x] Start Metro bundler successfully
- [x] Document environment setup findings
- [x] Fix Prisma schema validation errors (8 errors resolved)
- [ ] **TEMPORARY WORKAROUND**: Replace complex roundRoutes.ts with simple version to get server running
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY**: Fix complex roundRoutes.ts with proper error handling, field mappings, and TypeScript compliance
- [ ] Start backend development server

## Notes
Setting up full-stack Golf application with React frontend, React Native mobile, and Node.js backend.

**CRITICAL TECHNICAL DEBT**:
- roundRoutes.ts has complex TypeScript errors due to schema field mismatches
- Original roundRoutes.ts saved as roundRoutes.complex.ts for future fixing
- Issues to resolve: field name mismatches (status vs finishedAt, name vs holeNumber), malformed include structures, type safety
- Must fix immediately after getting server running - this is production-critical code
