# Golf App: Incremental Development Plan

## No Shortcuts, Small Steps, Test Everything

Based on our hard-learned lesson: **Don't take shortcuts, create very small incremental updates for functionality and test as you go.**

---

## üéØ **INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY**

### **Core Principle**: Every step must be **testable**, **deployable**, and **functional**

Instead of building everything at once, we'll create a **working app** that gets progressively more sophisticated. Each phase delivers **real user value**.

## üß™ **TESTING STRATEGY**

### **Per-Step Testing Requirements**

Every step must include:

- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Core functionality works in isolation
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Features work with backend/database
- [ ] **UI Tests**: User interface behaves correctly
- [ ] **Device Tests**: Functionality works on physical device
- [ ] **Edge Case Tests**: Error handling and boundary conditions

### **Phase Gate Testing**

Before moving to next phase:

- [ ] **Complete Functionality**: All phase features work end-to-end
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: App responds quickly and smoothly
- [ ] **Battery Tests**: Features don't drain battery excessively
- [ ] **Network Tests**: App works with poor/no connectivity
- [ ] **User Testing**: Real golfers can use features successfully

### **Quality Gates**

No advancement without:

- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ No regression in previous features
- ‚úÖ Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- ‚úÖ User experience is intuitive and bug-free

## üìù **DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES**

### **The Golden Rules**

1. **No Shortcuts**: Every feature gets proper testing and validation
2. **Small Steps**: Break everything into testable increments
3. **Working Software**: Maintain a working app at all times
4. **User Focus**: Every feature must provide real user value
5. **Quality First**: Better to have fewer features that work perfectly

### **When in Doubt**

- **Make it smaller**: Break the step down further
- **Test first**: Write tests before implementing features
- **Ask users**: Get feedback on designs before building
- **Keep it simple**: Complexity is the enemy of reliability

**The goal is not to build everything quickly, but to build something great that works reliably for golfers worldwide.**
