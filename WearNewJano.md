# Wear OS Integration Project Plan

## Overview

Complete integration of Wear OS companion app with the Golf phone app using the Google Wearable API for production-ready communication.

## Current Status (Updated: January 24, 2025)

- ✅ Keystore issue fixed - both apps now use the same signing certificate
- ✅ Application ID fixed - both apps now use "com.minimalapp"
- ✅ Wearable API implementation complete - migrated from ADB to MessageClient API
- ✅ Test screen fully functional with all communication methods
- ✅ Full bidirectional communication (phone to watch, watch to phone)
- ✅ Complete UI implementation on watch with all screens
- ✅ Material Components theme crash fixed
- ✅ Shot recording with immediate club selection (100x100px buttons)
- ✅ Connect to Round feature for easy reconnection
- ✅ Auto-reconnect on app resume
- ✅ Production ready - no debug dependencies

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Keystore Fix

Previously, the phone and wear apps were using different keystores:

- Phone: `/mobile/android/app/debug.keystore`
- Wear: `~/.android/debug.keystore`
  This has been fixed - both apps now use the same keystore.

### 2. Application ID Fix (Root Cause)

The apps had mismatched application IDs:

- Phone: `com.minimalapp`
- Wear: `com.golfapp.wear` ❌

**Fixed:** Wear app now uses `com.minimalapp` to enable Wearable API communication.

### Required Steps After Fix:

1. Clean and rebuild both apps
2. Uninstall both apps from devices
3. Reinstall fresh builds
4. Test with WearOSTestScreen
