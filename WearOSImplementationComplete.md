# Wear OS Implementation Complete

## Summary
The Android Wear OS integration has been successfully completed with all requested features working. The watch app now provides immediate club selection when recording shots and syncs seamlessly with the phone app's existing shot and club tracking system.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Crash Fix
- Fixed MaterialButton theme crash by creating Material Components theme
- Fixed JSON parsing crashes with defensive programming (optString/optInt)
- Watch app now starts rounds reliably without crashes

### 2. Improved Shot Recording Interface
- **Immediate Club Selection**: When "Record Shot" is clicked, shows 12 club buttons immediately
- **Large Touch Targets**: 100x100 pixel buttons optimized for thumb interaction
- **Shot Tracking**: Automatically increments shot numbers (Tee Shot, 2nd Shot, 3rd Shot, etc.)
- **GPS Integration**: Captures location for each shot with accuracy indicator

### 3. Phone App Integration
- **Unified Tracking**: Watch updates the same shot/club data that phone app uses
- **Real-time Sync**: Shot data immediately updates scorecard on phone
- **Club Selection Sync**: Club choices from watch appear in phone's scorecard
- **Score Updates**: Each shot recorded on watch increments score on phone

## Technical Implementation

### Watch App Components
- `ShotRecordingFragment`: New fragment with immediate club grid
- Material theme support in styles.xml
- GPS location tracking with FusedLocationProvider
- Shot data includes: timestamp, location, accuracy, hole, shot number, club

### Phone App Integration
- `WearableModule`: Enhanced to handle shot data with club information
- `ScorecardView`: Updated to sync club selections from watch
- Event system propagates watch data to React Native UI

### Data Flow
1. User clicks "Record Shot" on watch
2. Club grid appears immediately (12 clubs)
3. User selects club with thumb
4. GPS location captured
5. Shot data sent to phone via Wearable MessageClient
6. Phone updates scorecard with shot and club
7. Watch resets for next shot

## File Changes
- Watch MainActivity: Fixed JSON parsing and theme issues
- ShotRecordingFragment: New component for improved UX
- WearableModule: Enhanced shot data handling
- ScorecardView: Syncs club data from watch
- styles.xml: Material Components theme
- AndroidManifest.xml: Updated theme reference

## Testing Instructions
1. Install both APKs (phone and wear)
2. Start a round on phone
3. On watch, click "Record Shot"
4. Select a club from the grid
5. Verify shot appears on phone scorecard with correct club

## Build Commands
```bash
# From android directory
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug    # Phone app
./gradlew :wear:assembleDebug   # Watch app
```

## APK Locations
- Phone: `mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- Watch: `mobile/android/wear/build/outputs/apk/debug/wear-debug.apk`

## Connect to Round Feature
### Problem
- Watch app loses connection when phone screen turns off or when switching apps
- Shows "No Active Round" even when a round is active on phone

### Solution
1. **Connect to Round Button**: Green button for manual reconnection
2. **Auto-Reconnect**: Automatically attempts connection on app resume
3. **Enhanced Persistence**: Phone maintains round data in memory and DataClient
4. **Status Messages**: Clear feedback during connection process

### Implementation
- Request/response pattern using `/round/request` and `/round/response`
- 5-second timeout with status updates
- Scrollable UI with golf emoji and connection status

## Status: COMPLETE âœ“
All requested features have been implemented and tested. The Wear OS integration provides a seamless golf tracking experience with thumb-friendly controls, real-time synchronization, and easy reconnection to active rounds.
